										<p align="center">Welcome to my online portfolio!<br /></p> 
										I recently finished my Master of Science in Astrophysics at the Geneva Observatory. I actively seek PhD positions to advance my knowledge and skillset in theoretical and observational aspects of exoplanetary astrophysics. One of my main goals is to better understand the formation and evolution of exoplanets, to which end I had focused my Master's thesis on the characterization of the architecture of planetary systems. This characterization sheds light on the possible physical mechanism responsible for the present state of exoplanets via development of a code that "observes" exoplanets as missions like KEPLER would. It is possible to further extend this code to other missions like the PLATO mission in order to optimize the mission's deliverables. <br />
										<br /><br />
										Keywords: Planetary Systems, Planet Formation, Exoplanetary Astrophysics, Exoplanet Atmospheres, Exomoons, Habitability.
									        <br /><br />
										Research Interests:
									        <br /><br />
										I enjoy studying the theoretical and observational aspects of Exoplanets. My current research envelopes Planet Formation, Planetary System Architecture, and Classification. Presently, I am developing tools that simulate the geometrical limitations and detection biases that concern transit observations (you can find a more comprehensive description here).<br />
										Other interests include direct detection techniques, exoplanet atmospheres, exomoons, stellar astrophysics etc.<br />
									</p>
									<p align="justify">
										A PhD will essentially entail a number of options in research, specific to available PhD advisors, but I hope to find positions that contain an overlap of one or more of the following disciplines:<br />
										<br />
										1) Formation and evolution of stars and planets.
										2) Involvement in Transit Surveys - observation times, data analysis to extract required parameters and link theory to observations. <br />
										2) Focus on the occurence rates for Earth-sized planets such that I can contribute to detection and characterization of Earth-analogs around nearby stars.<br />
										3) Teaching roles for inspiring undergrads and graduates, to increase future potential human resources for exoplanet research. <br />
										4) Discuss research through participation in science meets and involvement in science communication projects. <br />
										5) Open to work in instrumentation with my engineering experience, brief experience in exoplanet atmospheres during courses and the Sagan Summer Workshop 2021 and open to more exciting endeavors that come with the launch of JWST, PLATO, etc. <br /><br />
										Overall: I wish to be a part of the progress that the amazing community in exoplanetary astrophysics will make in the coming years by becoming a resource to it!

										<h4>My Personal Story</h4>
										<ul data-role="listview">
											<li>
											<p align="justify">
												I finished all the recommended mathematics books, from grade 8-12, in the summer before the 8th grade started. It filled me with the kind of zeal I got from reading - like stepping into a whole new world someone created with just their thoughts. In literature, it was a world built of words and in mathematics, of equations. Both fascinating, both open to interpretations such that you can pull a cord from someone else's world to create your own. My interest in any subject that involved an elegant use of mathematics was unavoidable. So I pursued computational fluid dynamics (CFD), astrophysics, attitude determination and control, pure mathematics and several other interests during my undergraduate years (2016-2020). I felt like a Reuleaux tetrahedron - capable of balancing a surface while rolling, but inefficient to be used as wheels for a vehicle.<br />
												Around 2.5 years into my undergraduate degree, a series of events unfolded that quite literally sanded my metaphorical Reuleaux tetrahedron personality. It started with Jaundice, which nearly took my life. After a miracuolous recovery with 1/10th of a liver, I was determined to pick up one line of inquiry that fulfilled me - gave me enough motivation and grit to beat anything I face in life. That is when I came across exoplanetary science. The prospect of uncovering our place in the universe excited me, and the rich mathematics involved in astrophysical computations fulfilled me. As I surveyed literature on exoplanets extensively, I came across citizen science projects and seminars by ICTS-TIFR. My efforts in this direction led to a paper presentation on exoplanet detection and characterization at Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. Weeks before the presentation, I met with 2 accidents - each of which compromised my ability to walk. I strapped on ankle support and bandages and went to the conference anyway. I volunteered for LIGO-INDIA in the same condition and wrote my TOEFL limping on one foot to the testing centre. <br />
												This is not a sad story - this is just one that tells me why finding a subject you're passionate about is so important. I haven't walked like a normal human being in 2 years - either a walker or an ankle support accompanied me everywhere - but not once have I ever felt the need to stop. When I see researchers mapping temperature brightnesses of exoplanets, achieving excellent contrast ratios, understanding planet formation and developing models and imaging planets in their protoplanetary disks - I am amazed. Constantly. <br />
												Being a part of such a dedicated, brilliant community of scientists and researchers is what keeps me going regardless of my circumstances. I lost a loved one, lost my walking ability, wrote 42 undergraduate exams in 1 week and much more - but never stopped, not once, for astrophysics fills me up with inspiration and determination that feels unearthly. Besides the many professional reasons I have for pursuing a PhD in Astrophysics, this is my biggest personal one - to contribute to this beautiful subject that trancends the ordinary and helps me push my limits and capabilities. <br />
