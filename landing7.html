										<h2>About</h2>

									<p>The gas turbine is an internal combustion engine that uses air as the working fluid. The engine extracts
                                        chemical energy from fuel and converts it to mechanical energy using the gaseous energy of the working
                                        fluid (air) to drive the engine and propeller, which in turn propel the airplane. As air passes through a
                                        gas turbine engine, aerodynamic and energy requirements demand changes in the air’s velocity and
                                        pressure. During compression, a rise in the air pressure is required, but not an increase in its velocity.
                                        After compression and combustion have heated the air, an increase in the velocity of gases is necessary
                                        in order for the turbine rotors to develop power. The size and shape of the ducts through which the air
                                        flows affect these various changes. Where a conversion from velocity to pressure is required, the
                                        passages are divergent. Conversely, if a conversion from pressure to velocity is needed, a convergent
                                        duct is used. Air Intakes are a necessity for any air-breathing engine, which are incorporated in most
                                        aero systems. The efficiency of the air intake directly and greatly influences the engine’s propulsive
                                        power
                                        
                                        This work explores the types of air intakes used in aerospace propulsion, their classification into
                                        different categories based on function and design. The types are then investigated through a survey of
                                        their application(s). The design – a bellmouth air intake used for ground testing is then studied. Effects
                                        of curvatures based on geometry of intakes have been studied using literature surveys of experiments
                                        involving CFD computations which employ RANS solver and Navier-Stokes Equations. To develop
                                        understanding of the regime of flow in and around a bellmouth air intake, pressure and velocity
                                        contours are generated using a commercial CFD program - ANSYS FLUENT, at different mach numbers
                                        and a mass flow rate of 11.8kg/sec. The process of air profiling, meshing and analysis is entirely done
                                        using ANSYS. Geometry of the bellmouth air intake is initially fabricated using CATIA V5. A grid
                                        independence study is carried out and an optimum meshing profile is chosen for the CFD analysis,
                                        particularly velocity and pressure contour plotting.</p></div>

											<h3>Results</h3>

									<p>Various types of air intakes with their functions were reviewed and their strengths were identified. The
                                        effects of curvature on flow regime were surveyed. The best design for Bellmouth intakes was identified
                                        and its construction based on various parameters was discussed. The study was carried out to validate a
                                        3-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a bellmouth intake with an elliptical design
                                        profile with the use of the CFD model as a design tool to replace or reduce the frequency of hydraulic
                                        model studies. A model was designed using CATIA V5, meshed and analyzed using ANSYS FLUENT and
                                        the results were presented and discussed. This finally paved way for generating conclusions about the
                                        behavior of flow in bellmouth air intakes and mapping it with results of simulation.
