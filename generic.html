										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>I am currently pursuing a specialization in Exoplanets as a Master's student at the Geneva Observatory. I am actively seeking PhD positions to advance my knowledge and skillset in theoretical and observational aspects of exoplanetary astrophysics. One of my main goals is to better understand the formation and evolution of exoplanets, to which end I have focused my Master's thesis on the characterization of the architecture of planetary systems. This characterization sheds light on the possible physical mechanism responsible for the present state of exoplanets via development of a code that "observes" exoplanets as missions like KEPLER would. I further extend this code to PLATO in order to maximize the mission's deliverables. </p>
									<p>A PhD will essentially entail a number of options in exoplanet research, specific to available PhD advisors, but I hope to find positions that contain an overlap of one or more of the following disciplines:<br />
										1) Involvement in Transit Surveys - observation times, data analysis to extract parameters and link theory to observations. <br />
										2) Focus on the occurence rates for Earth-sized planets such that I can contribute to detection and characterization of Earth-analogs around nearby stars.<br />
										3) Teaching roles for inspiring undergrads and graduates, to increase potential human resources for exoplanet research. <br />
										4) Discuss research through participation in science meets and involvement in science communication projects. <br />
										5) Open to work in instrumentation with my engineering experience, brief experience in exoplanet atmospheres during courses and the Sagan Summer Workshop 2021 and open to more exciting endeavors that come with the launch of JWST, PLATO, etc. <br /><br />
										Overall: I wish to be a part of the progress the beautiful community in exoplanetary astrophysics will make in the coming years by becoming a resource to it!
