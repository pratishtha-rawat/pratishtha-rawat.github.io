										<h2>About</h2>

									<p>Several models have been developed and studied to explain the current state of our universe.
                                        Unravelling the true mechanism behind galaxy formation and evolution will hugely impact our
                                        understanding of the present universe and is therefore, of great significance to Astronomy. To handle
                                        the overwhelming amount of data required to construct a complete evolutionary picture, an efficient
                                        technique of interpretation and analysis isrequired (like in Reddy et al., 2015).
                                        This project uses the method of studying emission properties of the galaxy population as a whole. It
                                        involves tracing the evolution of the galaxy luminosity density from the far-UV (FUV) to the far-infrared
                                        (FIR) with cosmic time. This gives a way to empirically resolve the global history of star formation in the
                                        Universe, autonomous of the complex evolutionary phases of the individual galaxy sub-populations. For
                                        the stated purpose, dust attenuation and different dust production mechanisms are briefly explored. An
                                        attempt to examine the findings of R. Maiolino et al. (2004) is made by taking a sample of 105 high
                                        redshift galaxies. In particular, these findings pointed towards a supernova origin for dust in a high-
                                        redshift quasar, which suggested the same could apply to galaxies at high redshifts. Exploring this tests
                                        the speculation that dust attenuation curves look different for the first generations of galaxies than at
                                        later times due to different dust production mechanisms. Recent spectroscopic redshift measurements
                                        together with extensive multiwavelength datasets are inspected to reconstruct the dust attenuation
                                        curve of z=4-6 galaxies, in other words to inspect galaxies within ~0.9-1.5 Gyr of cosmic history. These
                                        attenuation curves and obtained physical quantities, in turn, are used to see how the high redshift
                                        galaxies of our sample compare with the local universe galaxies. The goal is to model and fit the spectral
                                        energy distributions of star-forming galaxies using Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE) to gain a
                                        detailed understanding of how dust affects the properties. The techniques to perform the analysis are
                                        reviewed, along with developing understanding of dust formation and its influence on galaxy spectra. to
                                        gain a detailed understanding of how dust affects the properties.</p></div>

											<h3>Results</h3>
										</header>
									<p>The data is analyzed, results are interpreted and here the conclusions are briefly listed with the
                                        future scope of the project. The analysis suggests that the physical properties of galaxies are highly
                                        influenced by dust and this influence, in particular the preferential absorption of ultraviolet light which
                                        is reemitted in the IR, helps configure the dust properties and model attenuation curves. The
                                        attenuation curves are reconstructed using the slope of the attenuation curve, δ, obtained from CIGALE.
                                        Analysis of the physical quantities derived using SED modelling and fitting for galaxies sheds light on the
                                        dust properties. The IRX-beta plots suggest that the early universe galaxies fairly follow the starburst
                                        (Meurer) relation. There is roughly an overall trend that redder UV slopes correspond to higher IRX
                                        values. It can be said that even though galaxies of a particular type identify with their own IRX-β
                                        relations on a very precise level, the overall galaxy population presents a complicated picture. For the
                                        redshifts range studied in this project though, for both subsets and in both models, galaxies fairly
                                        comply with the Meurer relation with observable yet admissible scatter. With improved measurements
                                        and analysis in multi-wavelength datasets, the estimation of dust content from techniques like the IRX-β
                                        relation will probably yield more robust techniques.
                                        The attenuation curve reconstructed here gives two main observations: its slope in the UV/optical
                                        wavelength range and the absence of additional absorption at the near-UV, known as the UV bump.
                                        Since CIGALE allows for deviation of the slope from the slope of the Calzetti curve, attenuation curves
                                        both steeper than Calzetti curve and shallower than the Calzetti curve are obtained. The attenuation
                                        curves of our sample are more similar to the Calzetti curve than SMC (with δ ~ -0.45) for quite a few
                                        
                                        galaxies. The work also indicates that both attenuation laws – modified Calzetti and Charlot and Fall -
                                        model and fit the SEDs almost equally well, even with a key difference in their power laws. The Charlot
                                        and Fall model shows a higher correlation overall than the Calzetti model, neither of the observations
                                        being debatably far apart. Lastly, the work in projects like this can be further complimented by
                                        conducting a more comprehensive analysis that involves a more detailed modelling of physical
                                        properties and their interplay. Future observations with JWST and further growing observations in the
                                        millimeter/submillimeter by ALMA too has the scope to derive an accurate and more complete picture
                                        of galaxy evolution and cosmic star formation, as better observations can test existing theoretical
                                        models and pave way for improved empirical ones</p>
