									<p>The transit method has been one of the most useful and prominent methods of exoplanet
                                        detection. The basic principle behind transit measurements relies on the passage of a planet in front of
                                        its parent star. This causes a change in the observed flux, thus pointing towards the possible existence of
                                        a planet. To measure such changes, transit photometry is used. In this work, a procedure for extracting
                                        planetary transit parameters using observations of the parent star have been outlined and followed,
                                        which finally returns a transit curve and utilizing it, the required planetary parameters. We reduce
                                        photometric observations of a planetary transit to measure the flux drop as the exoplanet passes in
                                        front of its host star. The results may be improved with more measurements but suffice to demonstrate
                                        transit photometry herein. This project uses a sample of 42 frames of observations made on 31 October
                                        2017 with EulerCam, the CCD camera of at the 1.2m Euler telescope at La Silla observatory (Chile).
                                        
                                        Photometric extractions of the flux of star WASP-52, along with 3 other stars (reference stars) is done
                                        defining apertures. These measurements are then manipulated – first by dividing the target star flux by
                                        reference star flux and second by normalizing this relative flux – to best visualize and analyze the
                                        planetary transit. The results are interpreted and used for determination of planetary parameters.</p></div>

									<p>The star observed is WASP-52, with an exoplanet transiting at a period of ~1.75 days. The observational
                                        data comes from EulerCam, the CCD camera at the 1.2m Euler telescope at the La Silla observatory
                                        (Chile). From the performed photometry, it is found that the star (with some stellar parameters known
                                        and taken from different measurements) WASP-52 has a transiting exoplanet orbiting on a semi major
                                        axis of 0.03 AU, inclined at 86.13°. Multiple reference stars used for photometry also indicate that better
                                        results are obtained when the difference in apparent magnitudes of target star and reference star is
                                        lower.
                                        The analysis also suggests that even fundamental, short duration observations of transits are valuable in
                                        exoplanet findings. While single-transit observations cannot provide information about planet periods,
                                        combined with data from other observations, such data holds the potential to give fundamental
                                        planetary parameters like planet radius, inclination and semi-major axis of orbit, planet density and
                                        impact parameter. Considering the calculation, the visually best transit curve also returns planetary
                                        parameters closest to the original, giving a planetary radius of 1.243 R Jupiter . This value is correct to one
                                        decimal place, the difference from the original value being ~0.03 R Jupiter . The semi-major axis being just a
                                        function of period and stellar mass, doesn’t vary with our specification of reference stars as both values
                                        are external inputs. The impact parameter, the planet density and the orbital inclination experience
                                        considerable variation with selection of reference star. The impact parameter seems very sensitive to
                                        shape of transit, as also pointed out in Seager and Mall´en-Ornelas (2002).
                                        Analysis of the physical quantities derived complements the bias we say the current ground-based
                                        transit searches have - sensitivity towards close-in, large planets. The planet characteristics, specifically
                                        the radius and size of orbit, pave way for the possibility of the exoplanet being a Hot Jupiter. The same
                                        inference is a stated result in Hébrard et al., 2013.
                                        Overall, this analysis provides good insights into transit photometry and related calculations.
                                        Improvements in such an analysis can be made in a number of ways. Incorporating limb darkening
                                        effects, error modelling, transit curve fitting and multiple-transit observations may lead to more
                                        accurate determination of parameters. Furthermore, transit spectroscopy can give insights into the
                                        exoplanet’s atmosphere.</p>
